# SRParasites 1.10.6 NeoForge 1.21.1 Port Audit

This repository started as a blank NeoForge MDK. The source of truth for this
slice is `杂物/[逃逸：寄生体] SRParasites-1.10.6.jar`.

## Legacy Evidence Inspected

- `com.dhanantry.scapeandrunparasites.SRPMain`: legacy mod entrypoint and
  `srparasites` namespace.
- `com.dhanantry.scapeandrunparasites.init.SRPItems`: item registry names for
  living/sentient weapons, living/sentient armor, hijacked iron gear, drops, and
  basic parasite materials.
- `com.dhanantry.scapeandrunparasites.item.tool.WeaponToolMeleeBase`: melee
  living weapons store `srpkills`, use configured attack damage, attack speed,
  and optional reach.
- `com.dhanantry.scapeandrunparasites.item.tool.WeaponToolArmorBase`: living
  armor stores `srphits` and upgrades to sentient variants after the configured
  damage threshold.
- `com.dhanantry.scapeandrunparasites.item.tool.WeaponToolRangeBase`: living
  bows use configurable damage, bonus, and cap values.
- `com.dhanantry.scapeandrunparasites.util.config.SRPConfig`: defaults for
  living weapon durability, living-to-sentient thresholds, weapon damage/range,
  bow damage/cap, and living/sentient armor point settings.

## Implemented In This Slice

- Replaced the MDK example `psrp` namespace with the legacy `srparasites`
  namespace.
- Migrated legacy item models, item textures, and `.lang` files into 1.21.1
  resource locations.
- Registered the first real gameplay-facing item surface:
  - parasite drops and materials used by the legacy gear family,
  - hijacked iron tools and armor,
  - living and sentient melee weapons,
  - living and sentient greatbows,
  - living and sentient armor.
- Added NeoForge config values that mirror the legacy `SRPConfig` gear defaults.
- Added runtime attribute replacement through `ItemAttributeModifierEvent`.
- Added `srpkills` and `srphits` persistence through 1.21 data components.
- Added living-to-sentient upgrade hooks for weapons and armor.

## Explicit Gaps

This is not a complete mod port yet. The following systems still require their
own evidence-backed slices:

- parasite entities, AI goals, attributes, and animations,
- block registry and legacy block behavior,
- world evolution and phase systems,
- potions/effects and adaptation systems,
- bestiary GUI and networking,
- recipes, loot tables, advancements, and data generation,
- sounds and entity renderers.

Do not treat a build passing as full restoration. Future slices should continue
from legacy bytecode evidence and add verifier markers before broad claims.
